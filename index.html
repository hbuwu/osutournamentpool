		<div id="nm1" class="w3-container city w3-animate-left">
			<h2>Nomod 1</h2>
			<p>Fairly high density map, fairly aim based but there are technical kick sliders and streams here and there. imo easily chokable, so unless RNG is something we want it's not the greatest pick. </p>
		</div>

		<div id="nm2" class="w3-container city w3-animate-left" style="display:none">
			<h2>Nomod 2</h2>
			<p>Med/High BPM bursts + snaps, personally this map is easy as fuck LOL but it depends on whether we have good players for it. If we do, definitely a good pick.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="nm3" class="w3-container city w3-animate-left" style="display:none">
			<h2>Nomod 3</h2>
			<p>Super high density alt map, if we have the players for it this is a sick pick, and I *think* we do?</p>
		</div>

		<div id="nm4" class="w3-container city w3-animate-left" style="display:none">
			<h2>Nomod 4</h2>
			<p>Med/High CS with technical parts, a bit RNG-heavy but not too bad. Definitely one of the maps we should practice and get good at. If we get good at it this is really good pick.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="hd1" class="w3-container city w3-animate-left" style="display:none">
			<h2>Hidden 1</h2>
			<p>The buzz sliders are a bit RNG, the map itself is pretty technical. It's your typical HD onetrick type of map. Given we're full of reading players, this is a good pick I think.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="hd2" class="w3-container city w3-animate-left" style="display:none">
			<h2>Hidden 2</h2>
			<p>This is literally the anti-me map, but I think we have good players for it. Super finger control heavy as there are multiple double patterns. There are some parts that don't really follow the music and it threw me off pretty hard, idk if anyone else will have the same problem.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="hr1" class="w3-container city w3-animate-left" style="display:none">
			<h2>Hardrock 1</h2>
			<p>I honestly think this is the second easiest map in the pool--comfortable BPM and comfortable patterns. Not too aim heavy, and there aren't any technical streams. If we're super confident that we'll 4 way FC with good acc this is a good pick. Otherwise kinda risky.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="hr2" class="w3-container city w3-animate-left" style="display:none">
			<h2>Hardrock 2</h2>
			<p>Low BPM streams may tank acc. Otherwise it's not too hard. Consistency HR and it's only 2 minutes long. Definitely could end up being an acc battle.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="dt1" class="w3-container city w3-animate-left" style="display:none">
			<h2>Doubletime 1</h2>
			<p>Your typical AR8 DT pick. There are some kinda high-BPM streams but they're not too hard. Also can end up being an acc battle.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="dt2" class="w3-container city w3-animate-left" style="display:none">
			<h2>Doubletime 2</h2>
			<p>One of the weirdest DT picks I've seen. Still AR8 DT, but there are 4 note bursts that might throw you off and somewhere around 7/8th through the map there are these retarded sequences of buzz sliders, so if you're not good with buzz sliders or lag when there's a lot of them, do NOT play this during the actual match. Other than that, definitely will be an acc battle as well.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="fm1" class="w3-container city w3-animate-left" style="display:none">
			<h2>Freemod 1</h2>
			<p>This map is way too easy...why is this even in the pool LOL It's highly likely that other teams go for multiple mods on this simply due to the simplicity of the map--in that case we might actually have to try and match them. This map is way too easy. HD, HR, HDHR are all ideal.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="fm2" class="w3-container city w3-animate-left" style="display:none">
			<h2>Freemod 2</h2>
			<p>Snappy aim, but easier than NM2. HD is ideal, HR might be a bit hard.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="tb" class="w3-container city w3-animate-left" style="display:none">
			<h2>Tiebreaker</h2>
			<p>Bro this song's weird as fuck LOL Other than that it's super generic 3-note/5-note bursts + a few streams. Yeah it's one of those TBs, however keep in mind there is a stream + kick slider section towards the dead middle of the map that might be tricky. You don't have to play it, but at least take a look in the editor so you know what you're dealing with.</p>
